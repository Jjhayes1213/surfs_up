# Surfs Up

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to gather data for a business partner about temperature trends in the area  of Oahu where they intend to open a surf  and ice cream shop.  The temperature trends of Oahu will help determine whether this business could be successful.  A major factor to the location chosen for the surf/ice cream shop would be the year round warm weather.  Our analysis will provide valuable data to establish if this business could be sustainable all year round.


## Results
*Temperatures (in fahrenheit) for June and December:

June:
Highs: 85
Lows: 64
Average: 75

December:
Highs: 83
Lows: 56
Average: 71

*Weather in the 70s is likely ideal for surfing, so the months around December may be really good business for the part of the business that operates as the surf shop.

*Weather in the 70-80s is likely ideal for ice cream sales, so the months around June should have sizeable buiness to the ice cream shop side of the business.

## Summary
With the data gathered so far I would encourage the plan of the surf shop/ice cream shop to open in Oahu.  Another major weather determinant for opening the business in this location would be rainy weather or tropical storms.  A query of past years to determine how many days a year the business may be shut down to heavy rains would be the next step for these business partners.  Lastly I would query the weather data to determine how many overcast/cloudy days there are for previous years.  The cloudy weather may not impact the surf shop however it may directly impact the success of the ice cream shop.  For a business that sales are greatly impacted by the weather, I would recommend the review of these additional suggested queries.
